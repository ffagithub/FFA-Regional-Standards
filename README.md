Open Standards
==============

Why Open Standards
------------------

**Scale / Size**: Systems within the FFA membership have reached a tipping point
in size and scale where we need to take a step back and consolidate / adjust our
current approach.

**Complexity**: The current scale of the system magnifies cost and complexity.
If this is not actively addressed and managed, this complexity get worse as time
progresses and

1.  More and more features are added,

2.  More and more systems are introduced into the region

The impact of this complexity is

>   **Systems Fragility**: As the scale of the systems we manage increases so
>   too does the level of complexity. This in turn breeds fragility and
>   increases the risks of system failures.

>   **Systems Costs**: The costs of managing this increasing complexity is a
>   drain on resources (time, money and expertise).

Solution
--------

**Open Standards:** One way of addressing this complexity issue is via the
creation of open standards. These standards will provide the core building
blocks (data, processes, checklists) needed to:

1.  Provide the stability, predictability and repeatability needed to build
    simpler and more robust systems

2.  Improve and simplify the ability to exchange data between different systems

3.  Allow us to build systems at scale
