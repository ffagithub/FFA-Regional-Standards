Open Standards
==============

This is a repository for the Forum Fisheries Agencies Open Standards Initiative.
The aim of the initiative is to develop the standards required to simplify the
development of fisheries management information systems among our membership.

You can find all our Data, Process and Checklist standards here.

Why Open Standards?
-------------------

**Scale / Size**: Systems within the FFA membership have reached a tipping point
in size and scale where we need to take a step back and consolidate our efforts
to manage the increasing complexity of systems.

**Complexity**: The current scale of the system magnifies cost and complexity.
If this is not actively addressed and managed, this complexity get worse as time
progresses and

1.  More and more features are added,

2.  More and more systems are introduced into the region

The impact of this complexity is

**Fragility**: As the scale increases, so too does the level of complexity. This
in turn breeds fragility and increases the risks of system failures.

**Systems Costs**: As scale increases, the costs of managing this increasing
complexity is a drain on resources (time, money and expertise).

Solution
--------

**Open Standards:** One way of addressing this complexity issue is via the
creation of open standards. These standards will provide the core building
blocks (data, processes, checklists) needed to:

1.  Provide the stability, predictability and repeatability needed to build
    simpler and more robust systems

2.  Improve and simplify the ability to exchange data between different systems

3.  Allow us to build systems at scale
