Open Standards
==============

This is a repository for the Forum Fisheries Agencies Open Standards Initiative.
The aim of the initiative is to develop the standards required to simplify the
development of fisheries management information systems among our membership.

You can find all our Data, Process and Checklist standards here:

-   [Entity Data
    Standard](https://github.com/ffagithub/FFA-Regional-Standards/blob/master/Authorisation%20-%20Draft%20Standards%20-%20Data.md#entity):
    This standard defines the data fields required to capture information about
    entities. Entities are things like individuals, organizations, vessels etc.
    They can be legal entities like individuals, companies etc. or non-legal
    entities like vessels

-   [Condition Data
    Standard](https://github.com/ffagithub/FFA-Regional-Standards/blob/master/Authorisation%20-%20Draft%20Standards%20-%20Data.md#conditions):
    This standard defines the data fields required to capture information about
    a condition. Conditions can be applied to authorizations. Authorizations are
    things like licenses, agreements, permits etc.

-   [Authorization Data
    Standard](https://github.com/ffagithub/FFA-Regional-Standards/blob/master/Authorisation%20-%20Draft%20Standards%20-%20Data.md#authorisation):
    This standard defines the data fields required to capture information about
    an authorization. Authorizations are things like licenses, agreements,
    permits etc.

Why Open Standards?
-------------------

**Scale / Size**: Systems within the FFA membership have reached a tipping point
in size and scale where we need to take a step back and consolidate our efforts
to manage the increasing complexity of systems.

**Complexity**: The current scale of the system magnifies cost and complexity.
If this is not actively addressed and managed, this complexity will only get
worse as time progresses and

1.  More and more features are added,

2.  More and more systems are introduced into the region

The impact of this complexity is

**Fragility**: As the scale of systems increases, so too does the level of
complexity. This in turn breeds fragility and increases the risks of system
failures.

**Costs**: As the scale of systems increase, so too does the costs of developing
and maintaining these systems increases. If complexity isn’t properly managed
and mitigated there is an accelerated drain on resources (time, money and
expertise).

Solution
--------

**Open Standards:** One way of addressing this complexity issue is via the
creation of open standards. These standards will provide the core building
blocks (data, processes, checklists) needed to:

1.  Provide the stability, predictability and repeatability needed to build
    simpler and more robust systems

2.  Improve and simplify the ability to exchange data between different systems

3.  Allow us to build systems at scale
