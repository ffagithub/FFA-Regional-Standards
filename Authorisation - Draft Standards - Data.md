Notes: Questions needing Answers
================================

-   Is using UUID instead of database generated auto-increment numbers useful
    for scalability assuming multiple systems? Do we need to capture, domain and
    path?

-   How long a Captain has been on a particular vessel? Why? Important for
    history of infringements on captains for person of interest, MCS, Due
    Diligence

-   Issues sometimes not picked up in regional databases, need additional checks
    e.g. Google search vessel name for infringements / violations

Vessel Registry
===============

Data standards if you need to operate a vessel registry. Otherwise use
infrastructure already setup at FFA, WCPFC, SPC, Lloyds/IMO, Maritime/Transport
etc. If issues FIX ISSUES.
