Notes: Questions needing Answers
================================

-   How long a Captain has been on a particular vessel? Why? Important for
    history of infringements on captains for person of interest, MCS, Due
    Diligence

-   Issues sometimes not picked up in regional databases, need additional checks
    e.g. Google search vessel name for infringements / violations

Vessel Registry Data Standards
==============================

Only needed if you need to operate a vessel registry. Otherwise use
infrastructure already setup at FFA, WCPFC, Loyds/IMO, Maritime/Transport etc.
If issues FIX ISSUES.
